WP Admin Microblog
==================

WP Admin Microblog adds a separate microblog in your WordPress backend. The plugin transforms automatically urls to links, supports tagging and some bbcodes and it's possible to send a message via e-mail to other users. In addition you can read, respond, edit and delete messages directly from your dashboard. So, WP Admin Microblog is great for supporting the communication within blog teams or it's a nice scratchpad. ;-)
